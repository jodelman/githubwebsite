            figures with a low of only 7. In spite of these small numbers the
            Chapter continued until 1942 when Bro Joe Wren of Coronation Lodge
            offered himself a candidate for exaltation. He was responsible for
            bringing in many new members from his lodge. In the Coronation year
            of 1953 it was very appropriate that three members of Coronation
            Lodge occupied the three principals Chairs.</font></span><br />

            size="3">The meeting in June 1944 was memorable for two reasons
            first the proceedings were interrupted and punctuated by the
            explosion of Flying Bombs and secondly was a visit by one of the
            founders Ex Comp George Tapley-Smith who had been absent for some
            time due to ill health and was practically blind.</font></span><br />

        <span style="font-family: Times New Roman,Times,serif;"><font style="font-size: 12pt"
            size="3">Also, as you would expect, many of the Chapters members
            lived and worked in London and many companions having reached
            retirement age decided to move away. I think Comp Peter Martin
            started it by moving to Brixham in Devon although for many years he
            continued to attend and he caught a coach up to town on the morning
            of the meeting and then a return overnight coach after the meeting.
            We have also had a few others who have continued to attend regularly
            despite having to travel long distances.</font></span><br />
        <span style="font-family: Times New Roman,Times,serif;"> </span><br />
        <span style="font-family: Times New Roman,Times,serif;"><font style="font-size: 12pt"
            size="3">From its inception the Chapter had something of a nomadic
            existence as to where its convocations were held, usually in various
            hotels.. Starting off in 1932 at the Horseshoe Hotel W1 then the
            Park Hotel Hanwell then back to the Horseshoe followed by The
            Shaftsbury Hotel, No2 Whitehall Court, Clarendon Hotel and the
            Windsor Hotel at Lancaster Gate.</font></span><br />
        <span style="font-family: Times New Roman,Times,serif;"> </span><br />
        <span style="font-family: Times New Roman,Times,serif;"><font style="font-size: 12pt"
            size="3">The proposition for our last move in 1987 was made at a
            meeting at the Windsor Hotel was one of my early meetings and one
            that I remember well. Ex Comp Derek Briggs who many will recall with
            much affection got up in any other business and proposed a move the
            WLMC which had not been established very long and who were looking
            for Lodges and Chapters to join them. This seemed to cause much
            consternation to the Scribe E who was not expecting such a
            proposition. As a newish companion at that time I am not sure of
            what happened behind the scenes but the proposed move eventually
            took place and we have been very happily ensconced here for the last
            35 years.</font></span><br />

            size="3">Charity is one of our great principals and I have been
            through the books over the last twenty years and it might surprise
            some people that over that time we have donated just short of
            £25,000 allowing for inflation. Not bad for a small Chapter. </font></span>
        <br />
        <span style="font-family: Times New Roman,Times,serif;"> </span><br />
        <span style="font-family: Times New Roman,Times,serif;"><font style="font-size: 12pt"
            size="3">We have many historical documents with which I could bore
            you with names and dates but the more important than these are the
            people of the Chapter. Over the years we have had many Characters
            and just three come to my own mind. The first I never knew
            personally was Comp Nares-Pillow who had an extraordinary talent as
            an amateur hypnotist and there were many tales of his “work” results
            at festive boards. The second was Comp Jimmy Hoadley a man of small
            stature, who was closely associated with Christine Keeler and Mandy
            Rice-Davies and who had lurid tales of goings on at various night
            clubs. The last one in my memory is one who many will remember, Comp
            Ken Ackril. He was anything but small in stature and had many tales
            to tell at the festive board. In the Chapter meeting as a Grand
            Officer he had a unique ability when things were not going well,
            words not remembered, actions done incorrectly and tensions rising –
            to make a one line observation which made people laugh, settled
            tensions and enabled everyone to give of their best. There are many
            others who deserve mention but time is restricted.</font></span><br />

        <span style="font-family: Times New Roman,Times,serif;"><font style="font-size: 12pt"
            size="3">I know many will regard this meeting as a very sad time and
            the end of an era. I know it is but I believe we should look upon it
            as an opportunity for a new start – to join a new chapter and
            continue our delight of Chapter meetings in new circumstances.</font></span><br />

        <span style="font-family: Times New Roman,Times,serif;"><font style="font-size: 12pt"
            size="3">I have thoroughly enjoyed being a member of Hanwell Chapter
            and hope I will continue to see members at other meetings in the
            coming years Thank you to all members for the help, advice and
            support you have given me personally over the years.</font></span><br />
